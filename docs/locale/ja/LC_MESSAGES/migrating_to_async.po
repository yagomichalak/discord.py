"v0.10.0 is one of the biggest breaking changes in the library due to "
"massive fundamental changes in how the library operates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrating_to_async.rst:13
msgid ""
"The biggest major change is that the library has dropped support to all "
"versions prior to Python 3.4.2. This was made to support ``asyncio``, in "
"which more detail can be seen :issue:`in the corresponding issue <50>`. "
"To reiterate this, the implication is that **python version 2.7 and 3.3 "
"are no longer supported**."

"All events before were registered using :meth:`Client.event`. While this "

msgid "Event Changes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrating_to_async.rst:67
msgid ""
"Some events in v0.9.0 were considered pretty useless due to having no "

"events since previously they had no context on what was changed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrating_to_async.rst:93
msgid ""
"Note that ``on_status`` was removed. If you want its functionality, use "
":func:`on_member_update`. See :ref:`discord-api-events` for more "

"The biggest change that the library went through is that almost every "
"function in :class:`Client` was changed to be a `coroutine "
"<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html>`_. Functions that "
"are marked as a coroutine in the documentation must be awaited from or "

msgid "Iterables"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migrating_to_async.rst:126
msgid ""
"For performance reasons, many of the internal data structures were "
"changed into a dictionary to support faster lookup. As a consequence, "
"this meant that some lists that were exposed via the API have changed "
"into iterables and not sequences. In short, this means that certain "
"attributes now only support iteration and not any of the sequence "
"functions."
