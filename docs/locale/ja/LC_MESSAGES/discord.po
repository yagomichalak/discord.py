msgid ""
"In order to work with the library and the Discord API in general, we must"
" first create a Discord Bot account."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:8
msgid "Creating a Bot account is a pretty straightforward process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:10
msgid ""
"Make sure you're logged on to the `Discord website "
"<https://discordapp.com>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:11
msgid ""
"Navigate to the `application page "
"<https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me>`_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:12
msgid "Click on the \"New App\" button."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:17
msgid ""
"Give the application a name and a description if wanted and click "
"\"Create App\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:19
msgid ""
"You can also put an avatar you want your bot to use, don't worry you can "
"change this later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:20
msgid "**Leave the Redirect URI(s) blank** unless are creating a service."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:24
msgid ""
"Create a Bot User by clicking on the accompanying button and confirming "
"it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:28
msgid ""
"Make sure that **Public Bot** is ticked if you want others to invite your"
" bot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:30
msgid ""
"You should also make sure that **Require OAuth2 Code Grant** is unchecked"
" unless you are developing a service that needs it. If you're unsure, "
"then **leave it unchecked**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:36
msgid "Click to reveal the token."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:38
msgid "**This is not the Client Secret**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:39
msgid "Look at the image above to see where the **Token** is."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:43
msgid ""
"It should be worth noting that this token is essentially your bot's "
"password. You should **never** share this to someone else. In doing so, "
"someone can log in to your bot and do malicious things, such as leaving "
"servers, ban all members inside a server, or pinging everyone "
"maliciously."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:48
msgid "The possibilities are endless, so **do not share this token.**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:50
msgid ""
"And that's it. You now have a bot account and you can login with that "
"token."

#: ../../discord.rst:55
msgid "Inviting Your Bot"
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:57
msgid "So you've made a Bot User but it's not actually in any server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:59
msgid "If you want to invite your bot you must create an invite URL for your bot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:61
msgid ""
"First, you must fetch the Client ID of the Bot. You can find this in the "
"Bot's application page."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:66
msgid "Copy paste that into the pre-formatted URL:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:72
msgid ""
"Replace ``YOUR_CLIENT_ID`` with the Client ID we got in the previous "
"step. For example, in the image above our client ID is 312777964700041216"
" so the resulting URL would be "
"https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=312777964700041216&scope=bot&permissions=0"
" (note that this bot has been deleted)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:77
msgid ""
"Now you can click the link and invite your bot to any server you have "

"In the above URL, you might have noticed an interesting bit, the "
"``permissions=0`` fragment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:84
msgid ""
"Bot accounts can request specific permissions to be granted upon joining."
" When the bot joins the guild, they will be granted a managed role that "
"contains the permissions you requested. If the permissions is 0, then no "
"special role is created."
msgstr ""

#: ../../discord.rst:88
msgid ""
"This ``permissions`` value is calculated based on bit-wise arithmetic. "
"Thankfully, people have created a calculator that makes it easy to "
"calculate the permissions necessary visually."

"If you want to generate this URL dynamically at run-time inside your bot "
